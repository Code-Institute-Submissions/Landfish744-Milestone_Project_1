                <h3>Pre-Leeds United</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Leeds United's predecessor, Leeds City, was formed in 1904 and elected to League membership in 1905.
                    They drew bigger crowds to Elland Road following Herbert Chapman's arrival. In 1914 Chapman
                    declared; "This city is built to support top-flight football", but Leeds City were forcibly
                    disbanded and forced to sell off all their players by The Football League in 1919 in response to
                    allegations of illegal payments to players during the First World War. At Salem Chapel in 1919,
                    Leeds United was formed, and they received an invitation to enter the Midland League, being
                    voted into it on 31 October, taking the place vacated by Leeds City Reserves. Following Leeds City's
                    disbanding, Yorkshire Amateurs bought their stadium Elland Road. Yorkshire Amateurs offered to make
                    way for the new team under the management of former player Dick Ray.

                    The chairman of Huddersfield Town, Hilton Crowther loaned Leeds United £35,000, to be repaid when
                    Leeds United won promotion to the First Division. He brought in Barnsley's manager Arthur Fairclough
                    and on 26 February 1920, Dick Ray stepped down to become Fairclough's assistant.</p>

            <div id="decade">
                <h3>1920–1960</h3>
                <br>
                <p>On 31 May 1920, Leeds United were elected to the Football League. Over the following years, they
                    consolidated their position in the Second Division and in the 1923–24 season won the title and with
                    it promotion to the First Division. They failed to establish themselves and were relegated in
                    1926–27. After their relegation, Fairclough resigned, which paved the way for Ray to return as
                    manager. In the years up until the start of World War II Leeds were twice relegated; on both
                    occasions they were re-promoted the following season.

                    On 5 March 1935, Ray resigned and was replaced by Billy Hampson, who remained in charge for 12
                    years. In the 1946–47 season after the war, Leeds were relegated again, with the worst league record
                    in their history. After this season, Hampson resigned (he stayed with Leeds as their chief scout for
                    eight months) and was replaced in April 1947 by Willis Edwards. In 1948, Sam Bolton replaced Ernest
                    Pullan as the chairman of Leeds United. Edwards was moved to assistant manager in April 1948 after
                    just one year as manager. He was replaced by Frank Buckley.

                    Leeds remained in the Second Division until 1955–56, when they once again won promotion to the First
                    Division, inspired by John Charles. Charles was hungry for success at the highest level, and manager
                    Raich Carter was unable to convince him that Leeds could satisfy his ambitions. Charles was sold to
                    Juventus for a then world record of £65,000. The loss of Charles resulted in Leeds being relegated
                    to the Second Division in the 1959–60 season.</p>

                <h3>1961–1974: Don Revie era</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In March 1961, the club appointed former player Don Revie as manager, following the resignation of
                    Jack Taylor. His stewardship began in adverse circumstances; the club was "in financial
                    difficulty" and in 1961–62 only a win in the final game of the season saved the club from
                    relegation to the Third Division.[9] Revie implemented a youth policy and a change of kit colour to
                    an all-white strip in the style of Real Madrid, and Leeds won promotion to the First Division in
                    1963–64.

                    In the 1964–65 season, Leeds finished second to rivals Manchester United on goal average.[11] They
                    also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool at Wembley after extra-time.[11] In
                    the 1965–66 season, Leeds again finished second in the league, whilst also reaching the
                    semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing on aggregate to Spanish side Real Zaragoza despite
                    manager Revie ordering the fire brigade to flood the pitch before the replay at Elland Road.

                    The 1966–67 season saw Leeds finish 4th in the league, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the FA
                    Cup, losing 1–0 to Chelsea and the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing 2–0 to GNK Dinamo
                    Zagreb.

                    With Leeds failing to land a trophy, they nearly doubled their record transfer in 1967–68, buying
                    Sheffield United centre-forward Mick Jones for £100,000.[15] The season saw Leeds win their first
                    major trophy, the League Cup, with Terry Cooper scoring the only goal of a 1–0 victory against
                    Arsenal in the final. Leeds finished fourth in the First Division and were beaten in the FA Cup
                    semi-finals by Everton. They also reached a second successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final
                    and this time won the trophy, beating Hungarian club Ferencváros over two legs; Leeds won the first
                    leg 1–0, and a month later defended their lead with a 0–0 draw in Budapest.

                    Having found success in both domestic and European cup competitions, manager Revie chose to focus on
                    the league for the 1968–69 season. Leeds secured the title in April 1969 with a 0–0 draw with
                    challengers Liverpool at Anfield, whose supporters congratulated Leeds.[21] Leeds set a number of
                    records including most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a
                    still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following
                    season.[22][23] Leeds reinforced their front line breaking the British transfer record by signing
                    Allan Clarke from Leicester City for £165,000. They targeted the treble in 1969–70 and came
                    close to achieving this, only to fail on all three fronts in a congested close season, finishing
                    second in the league to Everton, losing the 1970 FA Cup final to Chelsea (after a replay), and
                    exiting the European Cup with a semi-final defeat to Celtic.

                    Having rejected an offer to manage Birmingham City, Revie chose to remain at Leeds for the 1970–71
                    season. Leeds and Arsenal both challenged for the title that season, though it would be the
                    Gunners who would claim the league title, finishing one point ahead of Leeds after the latter lost
                    to West Bromwich Albion following a controversial "offside" goal. United were also knocked out
                    of the FA Cup by Fourth Division side Colchester United. Leeds again found success in the
                    Inter-Cities Fairs Cup though, beating Juventus in the final on away goals. Leeds again finished
                    as runners-up in the 1971–72 season, but United did reach the 1972 FA Cup final, lifting the trophy
                    after a 1–0 victory over Arsenal in the final.

                    In the 1972–73 season, the Whites again came close to a Treble, but they finished third in the
                    league, losing the 1973 FA Cup final to Second Division Sunderland 1–0 against all
                    expectations, and reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup against Italian club AC
                    Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium, where they were beaten 1–0 following some controversial
                    refereeing by Christos Michas who was later banned by UEFA for 'fixing' other matches. Revie was
                    offered the managers role at Everton in the summer, but chose to remain at Leeds. The following
                    season, they won the 1973–74 First Division with a five-point lead over second-placed Liverpool.
                    Revie chose to take the job of England national team manager at the end of the 1973–74 season.

                    In his 13 years in charge, Revie guided Leeds to two Football League First Division titles, one FA
                    Cup, one League Cup, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one Football League Second Division title and one
                    Charity Shield. He also guided them to three more FA Cup Finals, two more FA Cup Semi-finals, one
                    more Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Semi-final, one European Cup
                    Winners' Cup Final and one European Cup Semi-final. The team also finished second in the Football
                    League First Division five times, third once and fourth twice. In a survey of leading football
                    writers, historians and academics by Total Sport magazine, Revie's Leeds United were voted as one of
                    the 50 greatest football teams of all time.</p>

            <div id="decade">
                <h3>1974–1988: Post-Revie and relegation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Following the 1973–74 season, Revie left Leeds and Elland Road to manage the England national team.
                    Brian Clough was appointed as Revie's successor. This was a surprise appointment, as Clough had been
                    an outspoken critic of Revie and the team's tactics. Clough's tenure as manager started badly,
                    with defeat in the Charity Shield against Liverpool in which Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan were
                    sent off for fighting. Under Clough, the team performed poorly, and after only 44 days he was
                    dismissed.

                    Clough was replaced by former England captain Jimmy Armfield. Armfield took Revie's ageing team to
                    the final of the 1974–75 European Cup, in which they were defeated by Bayern Munich under
                    controversial circumstances. Assisted by coach Don Howe, Armfield rebuilt Revie's team, and
                    though it no longer dominated English football, it remained in the top ten for subsequent seasons.
                    However, the board became impatient for success and dismissed Armfield in 1978, replacing him with
                    Jock Stein, who also lasted just 44 days before leaving to manage Scotland. The board appointed
                    Jimmy Adamson, but he was unable to stop the decline, and in 1980 Adamson resigned and was replaced
                    by former player Allan Clarke. Despite spending freely on players, he was unable to stem the tide,
                    and the club was relegated at the end of 1981–82. Clarke was replaced by former teammate Eddie
                    Gray.

                    With no money to spend on team building, Gray concentrated on youth development, but was unable to
                    guide them to promotion from the Second Division.[41] The board again became impatient and dismissed
                    Gray in 1985, replacing him with another Revie teammate, Billy Bremner. Bremner found it just as
                    difficult to achieve promotion, although Leeds reached the 1987 play-off final, but were defeated by
                    Charlton Athletic. Leeds also endured a near miss in the FA Cup, losing out to Coventry City in the
                    semi-finals.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="decade">
                <h3>1988–1996: Howard Wilkinson era</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In October 1988, with the team 21st in the Second Division, Bremner was fired to make way for Howard
                    Wilkinson. Leeds avoided relegation that season, and in March 1989 signed Gordon Strachan from
                    Manchester United for £300,000. The Scottish midfielder was named captain, and helped Leeds win the
                    Second Division in 1989–90 and gain promotion back to the First Division. Leeds finished fourth
                    in 1990–91, and in the 1991–92 season they became champions of England for the third time. During
                    the close season Leeds were founder members of the new Premier League, which became the top division
                    of English football. However, the 1992–93 season saw Leeds exiting the Champions League in the early
                    stages, and eventually finishing 17th in the league (having won no away matches in the league),
                    narrowly avoiding relegation. Wilkinson's Leeds were unable to provide any consistent challenge for
                    honours, and his position was not helped by a poor display in the 1996 League Cup final which Leeds
                    lost to Aston Villa. Leeds could only finish 13th in 1995–96, and after a 4–0 home defeat by
                    Manchester United early in 1996–97, Wilkinson had his contract terminated. One of the legacies of
                    Wilkinson and youth coach Paul Hart was the development of Leeds United's youth academy, which has
                    produced numerous talented footballers over the years.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="decade">
                <h3>1997–2001: Graham and O'Leary</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Leeds appointed George Graham as Wilkinson's successor. This appointment was controversial as Graham
                    had previously received a one-year ban from The Football Association for receiving illegal payments
                    from a football agent. Graham made some astute purchases and also helped blood youngsters from
                    Leeds' youth cup winning side. By the end of the 1997–98 season, Leeds had qualified for the
                    following season's UEFA Cup. In October 1998, Graham left to become manager of Tottenham Hotspur,
                    and Leeds opted to replace him with assistant manager David O'Leary.

                    Under O'Leary and assistant Eddie Gray, Leeds never finished outside the top five in the Premier
                    League, and secured qualification for both the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League, enjoying cup
                    runs to the semi-finals of both competitions. However, during the same period, the team's image was
                    tarnished when players Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer were involved in an incident that left an
                    Asian student in hospital with severe injuries. The resulting court case took nearly two years to
                    resolve; Bowyer was cleared, but Woodgate convicted of affray and sentenced to community service.
                    Additionally, in the UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul, two Leeds fans were
                    stabbed to death before the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="decade">
                <h3>2001–2007: Financial crisis and fall to League One</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Under chairman Peter Ridsdale, Leeds had taken out large loans against the prospect of the share of
                    the TV rights and sponsorship revenues from Champions League qualification and subsequent progress
                    in the competition. However, Leeds narrowly failed to qualify for the Champions League in two
                    successive seasons, and as a consequence did not receive enough income to repay the loans. The first
                    indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United
                    for approximately £30 million. Ridsdale and O'Leary publicly fell out over the sale, and O'Leary
                    was dismissed and replaced by former England manager Terry Venables. Leeds performed woefully
                    under Venables, and other players were sold to repay the loans, including Jonathan Woodgate, whom
                    Ridsdale had promised Venables would not be sold. Tensions mounted between Ridsdale and Venables
                    and, with the team underachieving, Venables was dismissed and replaced by Peter Reid.[49][50]
                    Ridsdale resigned from the Leeds board and was replaced by existing non-executive director Professor
                    John McKenzie. At this time Leeds were in danger of relegation, but managed to avoid the drop in the
                    penultimate game of the season, beating Arsenal 3–2 away with a late strike by Mark Viduka.

                    Reid was given a permanent contract at Leeds the following summer and brought in several players on
                    loan. An unsuccessful start to the 2003–04 season saw Reid dismissed, and Eddie Gray take over as
                    caretaker manager until the end of the season. An insolvency specialist, Gerald Krasner, led a
                    consortium of local businessmen which took over Leeds and oversaw the sale of the club's assets,
                    including senior and emerging youth players of any value. Leeds were relegated during the 2003–04
                    season.

                    Following relegation to the Championship, assistant manager Kevin Blackwell was appointed manager.
                    Most of the remaining players were sold or released on free transfers to further reduce the high
                    wage bill; Blackwell was forced to rebuild almost the entire squad through free transfers, and Leeds
                    were forced to sell both their training ground and stadium in the autumn of 2004.

                    In 2005, the club was bought by Ken Bates, who paid £10 million for a 50% stake. Under
                    Blackwell, Leeds reached the Championship play-off final, which they lost to Watford. With the
                    team performing poorly, Blackwell's contract was terminated,[56] and Leeds hired John Carver as
                    caretaker manager, but his spell was not a success and he was relieved of his duties, with Dennis
                    Wise eventually installed as his replacement. Wise was unable to lift the team out of the relegation
                    zone for much of the season, despite bringing in a number of experienced loan players and free
                    transfers on short-term deals. With relegation virtually assured, Leeds entered administration on 4
                    May 2007, thus incurring a league-imposed 10-point deduction that officially relegated the club to
                    the third tier of English football; the club had previously never played any lower than the
                    second tier. The players whom Wise had brought in were released; he was forced to build a squad
                    almost from scratch, and because of administration Leeds were unable to sign any players until a few
                    days before the opening game of the season.</p>

                <h3>2007–2010: League One</h3>
                <br>
                <p>On 3 July 2007, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) lodged a legal challenge to Leeds' Creditors' Voluntary
                    Agreement (CVA). Under league rules, if the club were still in administration at the start of
                    the following season, Leeds would have been prevented from starting their season by the Football
                    League. Following the challenge by HMRC, the club was put up for sale by KPMG, and again
                    Ken Bates' bid was accepted. The League eventually sanctioned this under the "exceptional
                    circumstances rule" but imposed a 15-point deduction due to the club failing to exit administration
                    with a CVA, as the Football League rules required. On 31 August 2007, HMRC decided not to pursue
                    its legal challenge any further.

                    Despite the 15-point deduction, Wise and his assistant Gus Poyet guided Leeds to a play-off
                    position, only for Poyet to leave for Tottenham, and Wise quitting to take up a position at
                    Newcastle United. Wise was replaced by former club captain Gary McAllister. Leeds went on to
                    secure a place in the play-off final, but were beaten by Doncaster Rovers. The following season saw
                    a poor run of results, and McAllister was dismissed after a run of five defeats in a row. He was
                    replaced by Simon Grayson, who resigned from his post as manager of Blackpool to take the
                    position. Under Grayson, Leeds made the play-offs once again, but were beaten over the two legs
                    of the semi-finals by Millwall.

                    In the 2009–10 season, the team secured the best start ever to a season by a Leeds side, and caused
                    a major upset in the third round of the FA Cup by beating Manchester United at Old Trafford.
                    After the impressive run in the FA Cup, Leeds' league form suffered, with the team taking just seven
                    points from a possible 24. However, the team rallied and Leeds won their final game of the season to
                    confirm promotion to the Championship as runners-up to Norwich City.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="decade">
                <h3>2010–2014: Return to the Championship</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Leeds spent much of the 2010–11 season in the play-off places, but eventually finished in seventh
                    place, just missing out on the play-offs.

                    In May 2011, it was announced that Leeds chairman Ken Bates had bought the club and become the owner
                    of Leeds. Before the match against Middlesbrough, about 300 Leeds fans protested about what they
                    saw as a lack of investment in the playing side, to which Bates responded by calling the protesters
                    "morons".

                    Despite securing promotion to the Championship, Grayson was dismissed after failing to mount a
                    consistent challenge for promotion to the Premier League. Neil Warnock was appointed as the
                    club's new manager on 18 February, with his initial contract lasting until the end of the 2012–13
                    season.

                    On 21 November 2012, Middle East-based private equity group GFH Capital finalised a deal for a
                    protracted takeover of Leeds, gaining a 100% shareholding in the club. It was also announced Ken
                    Bates would remain as chairman until the end of the 2012–13 season and then become club
                    president. The takeover was officially completed on 21 December 2012.

                    Despite runs to the quarter-finals of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup (albeit with
                    both runs ending in five-goal thrashings, by Chelsea and Manchester City respectively), Leeds'
                    league form in the 2012–13 season was generally mediocre, with the club never making any real
                    challenge for the play-off places. Warnock resigned with six games remaining, and Leeds just five
                    points above the relegation zone. Brian McDermott replaced Warnock, and the club won three of
                    their final five games of the season, enough to avoid relegation. That summer, Bates stepped down as
                    chairman, and ultimately left the club altogether a few weeks later following a dispute over
                    expenses.

                    On 7 January 2014, Leeds United's managing director David Haigh was involved in Sport Capital, a
                    consortium involving the managing director of Leeds United's main sponsors, Enterprise Insurance,
                    Andrew Flowers. Sports Capital came close to completing a transaction with GFH Capital that would
                    have given them a 75% stake in the business.

                    On 30 January, Sport Capital's takeover collapsed due to a lack of "financial backing". Haigh
                    released a statement conceding that it was unable to complete a deal despite two months ago agreeing
                    to purchase a 75% stake in the club from the owners Gulf Finance House. Haigh said he and Sport
                    Capital had "injected substantial sums into the club to ensure its viability" but earlier in the
                    week fellow consortium member Andrew Flowers, the managing director of Leeds' shirt sponsor
                    Enterprise Insurance, stated that GFH had "breached their covenant with us" after inviting a rival
                    bid from Massimo Cellino, the president of the Serie A club Cagliari Calcio. Haigh's statement
                    read:

                    As fans know, we signed a share acquisition agreement with GFH Capital at the end of last year. This
                    meant, I believed, that we were in a position to move things forward and complete the transaction in
                    time for the January transfer window. ... Unfortunately, however, some of the consortium's backers
                    ultimately didn't feel able to deliver the financial backing we had hoped was agreed to take the
                    club forward.

                    On 31 January 2014, under controversial circumstances, it was reported that manager Brian McDermott
                    had been removed from his position as the club's manager following a string of poor results, while
                    the controversy surrounding the club was resolved. New club captain Ross McCormack expressed his
                    support for the former manager. By 3 February the BBC was reporting that McDermott had been
                    called by a lawyer representing Massimo Cellino "and told he had been relieved of his duties".
                    However, Cellino still did not own the club, as the Football League had not yet approved his
                    purchase, so neither he nor his lawyer could dismiss the manager. McDermott, therefore, remained in
                    his post.

                    After weeks of speculation regarding the purchase of Leeds United, on 7 February 2014, Leeds
                    United had announced that they had exchanged contracts for the sale of Leeds to Cellino's family
                    consortium Eleonora Sport Ltd. The deal saw the Cellino family acquire a 75% ownership of the club,
                    subject to Football League Approval.

                    At its meeting on 23 March 2014, the board of the Football League decided unanimously that Cellino's
                    conviction by an Italian court meant that he did not meet its owners and directors test, so could
                    not take over Leeds United.

                    In the backdrop of Cellino's takeover, Leeds suffered an appalling second half of the season,
                    dropping from the play-off places to the fringes of the relegation battle. In the end, the weak
                    performances of the teams below Leeds meant that they were never in any real danger of going down,
                    and a late run of wins put survival beyond doubt well before the end of the season. However,
                    McDermott still resigned his position a few weeks after the season ended.</p>

            <div id="decade">
                <h3>2014–2017: Cellino era</h3>
                <br>
                <p>On 5 April, Cellino was successful in his appeal with independent QC Tim Kerr to take over the
                    club. The takeover was completed on 10 April, with Cellino's company, Eleonora Sport Limited,
                    buying 75% of the club's shares. Two months later, the inexperienced Dave Hockaday was
                    surprisingly appointed head coach, with Junior Lewis hired as his assistant. After only 70 days, the
                    pair were fired by Cellino. Darko Milanič was given the head coach position in September
                    2014 becoming the club's first manager from outside the British isles and the first Slovene manager
                    in English football, but left the club the following month. On 1 November 2014, Neil
                    Redfearn was confirmed as the new head coach.

                    On 1 December 2014, Cellino was disqualified by the Football League after it obtained documents from
                    an Italian court, where he was found guilty of tax evasion.[93] He was disqualified from running the
                    club until 10 April 2015, and on 24 February 2015, Cellino announced he would not be returning to
                    the club after his ban ended. Redfearn was replaced by former Manchester City Player Uwe Rösler
                    as head coach in May 2015, but Rosler was himself replaced by Steve Evans after only a few
                    months in the role.

                    On 30 October 2015, Cellino agreed a deal in principle with Leeds Fans Utd to sell a majority stake
                    in the club. When asked to legally commit to an exclusivity period to allow due diligence to
                    commence, he reneged.

                    On 2 June 2016, Garry Monk was appointed as the new head coach, replacing Steve Evans. On 4
                    January 2017, Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani purchased a 50% stake in the club from Massimo
                    Cellino. At the close of the 2016–17 season, Leeds narrowly missed out on the play-offs. Leeds
                    had been in the play-off positions for the majority of the season before a poor run of form in the
                    final games saw them drop into seventh place. This was compounded by being knocked out in the fourth
                    round of the FA Cup by non-League side Sutton United 1–0, who, at the time, were 83 places and three
                    divisions below Leeds.</p>

            <div id="decade">
                <h3>2017–2023: Radrizzani takeover and Premier League return</h3>
                <br>
                <p>On 23 May 2017, Radrizzani announced a 100% buyout of Leeds United, buying the remaining 50% shares
                    from previous co-owner Massimo Cellino, with Radrizzani taking full ownership of the club.
                    Garry Monk resigned as head coach two days after the takeover, after one season at the club in which
                    he guided them to seventh place. In June 2017, former Spain international Thomas Christiansen
                    was announced as the new head coach. This was followed by Radrizzani introducing Leeds United
                    Ladies back to Leeds United ownership.[ Also in June, Radrizzani completed the purchase of
                    Elland Road from Jacob Adler's company, Teak Commercial Limited for £20 million, using his own
                    company Greenfield Investment Pte Ltd.

                    On 4 February 2018, Christiansen was dismissed after a bad run of games, leaving the team 10th in
                    the Championship table. On 6 February, Paul Heckingbottom was confirmed as Christiansen's
                    replacement. On 24 May 2018, Leeds announced that 49ers Enterprises had bought shares in the club to
                    become a minority investor. The 49ers Enterprises is the business arm of the NFL side San Francisco
                    49ers, owned by Denise DeBartolo York, Jed York, and Rose York.

                    Heckingbottom was dismissed by Leeds on 1 June 2018 after being at the club for just four
                    months. Argentine manager Marcelo Bielsa was named the club's new manager on 15 June, signing a
                    two-year contract with an option of a third year. In doing so he became the highest-paid manager in
                    Leeds United's history.

                    Bielsa's first season in charge saw Leeds make an impressive start and Leeds remained in the top 2
                    with Norwich City for the majority of the season, on course for automatic promotion to the Premier
                    League. However, a poor end to the season saw the team lose out on automatic promotion to Sheffield
                    United. They entered the play-offs against Derby County; despite winning the first leg 1–0,
                    they ultimately lost 4–3 on aggregate which consigned them to another season in the
                    championship.

                    On 17 July 2020, after 16 years out of the Premier League, Leeds were promoted back to the top
                    flight following West Bromwich Albion's loss to Huddersfield Town. Stoke City's defeat of
                    Brentford the following day confirmed they would go up as winners of the Championship.[115] Leeds
                    had been in the top 2 for most of the season and had never dropped lower than 5th in the table,
                    eventually going on to finish 10 points clear of West Brom in 2nd.

                    The club's first season back in the Premier League produced a top half finish, their points tally
                    was the most by a newly promoted side since Ipswich Town two decades earlier. However, the
                    following season was not as successful and following a series of poor results, Bielsa was dismissed
                    by the club in February 2022. Jesse Marsch was appointed as Bielsa's replacement, and he
                    successfully led the club to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. Marsch was
                    dismissed by the club in February 2023, and was replaced by Javi Gracia. Gracia was
                    dismissed in May, having won just three of his twelve games in charge, and was replaced by Sam
                    Allardyce as the club aimed to avoid relegation for the second successive season. However, he
                    was unable to prevent relegation as Leeds dropped back into the Championship on the final day of the
                    season.</p>
